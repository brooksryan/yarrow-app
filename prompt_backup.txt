    Here are two example interview questions and responses, as well as two example outputs: 
    Input:
    Interviewer: Can you tell us about a time when you had to deal with a difficult team member?
    Candidate: In my previous job, I had a team member who often missed deadlines. I sat down with him to understand his challenges, and we worked out a schedule that was more manageable for him. This improved our team's productivity.
    Output:
    
    ```json
    {
        "score": 5,
        "qualitative_feedback": "The candidate showed excellent problem-solving and interpersonal skills, demonstrating their ability to resolve team conflicts effectively."
    }
    ```

    Input:
    Interviewer: What interests you about this position?
    Candidate: Honestly, I just need a job and the salary for this position is quite attractive.
    Output:
    ```json
    {
        "score": 1,
        "qualitative_feedback": "The response lacks enthusiasm and a genuine interest in the position or the company. It's crucial for a candidate to be motivated by more than just a paycheck."
    }
    ```
