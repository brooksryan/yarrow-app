# Things we're building next
* **Conversation History**: "Let me review all of the questions I've been asked, my answers, and the rating of those answers"
* **Interview performance trends**: "How have my interview performances trended over time based on the AI evaluation?"
* **Custom interivew questions**: "I want to be able to tailor the questions I'm asked to the specific interview I'm practicing for"
* **Interview suites**: "I want to create a set of questions that I want to answer in order so that the practice feels more like a real interview" 



# Setup

### 1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Conversational_AI_Assistant.git
cd Conversational_AI_Assistant
```
### 2. **Install the necessary Python packages. It's recommended to do this in a Python virtual environment.**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
### 3. **You will also need to install some additional software dependencies:**

PortAudio: This is used by PyAudio, which is required to access the microphone. You can install it using the following command:

On Ubuntu üêß:
```bash
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
```
On macOS üçé:
```bash
brew install portaudio
```
ffmpeg: This is required for the audio processing. You can install it using the following command:

On Ubuntu üêß:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```
On macOS üçé:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
### 4. **You need to set up your environment variables for the application to work. This includes your Coqui API token, Google Cloud API token, and OpenAI API token.**

Create a .env file in your project directory and add the following lines (replace <YOUR_TOKEN> with your actual tokens):

```bash
COQUI_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_COQUI_API_TOKEN>
GOOGLE_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_GOOGLE_API_TOKEN>
OPENAI_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_TOKEN>
```
### 5. **You can now run the assistant:**

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage
Once you run the assistant, it will prompt you with a message indicating that it's ready to start. The assistant will then provide a situation and personas for the interaction. You will interact with the assistant verbally, and it will respond in kind.
